Cross-sectional associational analysis
===================================

Undergraduate sample size after key-variable cleaning: n=145
Undergraduate sample size with controls: n=144

Perceived MAcc necessity index (1-5; higher = more necessary)
- Mean (aware): 3.142
- Mean (not aware): 3.675
- Welch t-test p (approx): 0.0000
- Mann-Whitney p (approx): 0.0000

Adjusted OLS association (index outcome):
- Aware coefficient: -0.553 (p≈0.0000)
  Interpretation: awareness is associated with higher/lower index depending on sign;
  this is not a causal estimate due to cross-sectional observational design.

Binary robustness outcome (1=leans necessary, 0=neutral/optional)
- Share necessary (aware): 0.511
- Share necessary (not aware): 0.825
- Two-proportion z-test p (approx): 0.0001
